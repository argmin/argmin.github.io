### Regularization

This post is to provide a setting to explore one of the fundamental concepts in statistical learning - regularization.

#### Problem Setting

The goal of supervised learning is to find a function $$ f $$ in the hypothesis space $$ H $$ such that it approximately fit data points $$ S $$

$$
S = \textbraceleft (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ... , (x_n, y_n) \textbraceright
$$
