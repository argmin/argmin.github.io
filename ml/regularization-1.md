### Regularization

This post is to provide a setting to explore one of the fundamental concepts in statistical learning - regularization.

#### Problem Seeting

The goal of supervised learning is to find a function $$ f $$ in the hypothesis space $$ \mathcal{H} $$ such that it approximately fit data points $$ \mathcal{S} $$

$$
\mathcal{S} = \textbraceleft (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ... , (x_n, y_n) \textbraceright
$$
